<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->

## Features and Functionality

![ExhibitoLogo](../assets/Homepage%20mock%20up%20transparent.png)

### Feature 1

The dashboard shows three features. 1st a youtube video showing the top goals for Manchester United. The 2nd feature is the top scorer in the premiere league that's populated using the API. Lastly the upcoming game between 2 teams are populated using the API.

### Feature 2

The Comparison page is where two teams are compared using 3 charts; a bar graph, a radar chart and a pie chart. The user is able to choose 2 teams from a dropdown menu. Once the teams are chosen the team emblem and information as well as the bar graph is rendered. 
The user then chooses players from the chosen teams where a comparison between the 2 player are done using the Radar chart and the pie chart.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->

## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project.

### Ideation

For the ideation we designed a mood board and also determined our colour palette and typography

### Wireframes

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

Certainly! Here’s a filled-out version of the `Development Process` section:

---

## Development Process

The `Development Process` outlines the technical implementations and functionalities included in both the frontend and backend of the Exhibito application.

### Implementation Process

- **Project Setup and Environment Configuration**:
  - Initialize a new `React.js` project using tools like Create React App or set up manually.
  - Install `Axios` using npm or yarn to handle HTTP requests.
  - Install `Chart.js` library and configure it to create charts and graphs.
  - Add `Bootstrap` to the project for responsive layout and UI components.
  - Used `React Router` for seamless client-side routing.

- **Component Development**:
  - React Components: Create functional or class-based components to structure the UI.
  - Component Styling: Use CSS to style components, complemented by Bootstrap for responsive design
  - API Integration: Use `Axios` to fetch data from external APIs (like football data APIs) and manage state using React hooks like useState and useEffect.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - `Chart.js`: Implement various types of charts (e.g., bar charts, radar charts) to visualize data fetched from APIs.
  - Customization: Customize charts with options provided by Chart.js, such as colors, labels, tooltips, etc.


#### Highlights

- Designing my first react app was very fulfilling
- Integrating the API in a responsive way

#### Challenges

<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->

- Figuring out how react works and how to implement routing in a new way.
- Finding and researching appropriate APIs

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- Adding more animations and interactivity.

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
